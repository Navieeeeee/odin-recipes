            <li>1/4 Â¼ tsp green chilli paste</li>
            <li>5 g aam'er achar'er tel (oil from green-mango pickle)</li>
            <li>3 g mustard oil</li>
            <li>15 g onions</li>
            <li>10 g tomatoes</li>
            <li>5 g lime juice</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><b>Steps :</b></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Before starting, make sure that your muri is very crispy. You can microwave it for 30 seconds if you want.</li>
            <li>Boil potatoes. Peel and cut them into 1 cm cubes. Finely chop onions, green chillies, and ginger. Dice the tomatoes, removing the pulpy interior, or the muri will turn soggy. Chop coconut. Make a paste of green chillies.</li>
            <li>Take muri in a large mixing bowl. Add chanachur and bhujiya. Sprinkle bhaja moshla and black salt (beetnoon). Add boiled motor (yellow peas) and raw, sprouted chhola (whole Bengal gram). Add green chillies and ginger. Now, add the boiled and chopped potato. Add coconut. Add the dry(ish) ingredients first so that the muri does not turn soggy.</li>
            <li>Now, add green chilli paste. Drizzle some aam'er achaar'er tel (oil from green-mango pickle) and raw mustard oil. Add onions, tomatoes, and a squeeze lime juice.</li>
            <li>Mix quickly and serve.</li>
        </ol>
