        <h2>Egg curry has got to be one of the most loved dishes across Bangladesh and every region uses different spices and techniques to lift the flavour of the humble egg. It’s a staple at my home and definitely a fall back when I run out of fresh vegetables and meat. This Bengali Egg and potato curry is just the perfect midweek curry that’s hearty and lightly spiced. Served simply with plain rice it’s just the sort of meal we need for a cold winter evening.

        I’ve added a little tomato puree and purists might shun me for this! But it can be omitted depending on the quality of fresh tomatoes you have. The gravy is vibrant, light and just perfect to coat the egg and potato pieces. I love using mustard oil in Bengali cooking which adds so much more depth to the resultant dishes and the required pungent flavour. Although use vegetable oil if you can’t get hold of any.
